# Module 3: Operational Governance — The Sovereign Cycle

The Sovereign Cycle is the heartbeat of the LeeWay ecosystem. It is the mandatory 8-stage sequence that every request must clear to ensure safety, alignment, and quality before a user ever sees a result.

## The 8-Stage Heartbeat

1. **Perception:** Capturing and identifying the exact intent of the user request.
2. **Origin:** Identifying the root source and authority of the request (Validating who is asking).
3. **Structure:** Mapping the required agents, skills, and workflows needed for the task.
4. **Execution:** The actual technical work (e.g., writing code, searching data).
5. **Veritas (The Gate):** **CRITICAL STAGE.** A mandatory validation stage where the output is audited before it can proceed. It must meet the 85/100 score target.
6. **Echo:** Writing the experience to episodic and semantic memory for future continuity.
7. **Synthesis:** Combining the memory, the result, and the goal into a final compiled answer.
8. **Lee Prime:** The "Final Speaker"—the ultimate system authority who delivers the unified result to the user.

## The Final Speaker Rule
`Lee Prime` acts as the ultimate authority, ensuring the system always speaks with one unified voice after the Veritas gate validates all output.

## Example: Sovereign Cycle Payload
As a request moves through the 8 stages, it carries a strict state payload:
```json
{
  "stage": "5_VERITAS",
  "origin_auth": "Admin_Level_4",
  "structure_route": "NovaFamily",
  "execution_result": "Script generated.",
  "veritas_audit": {
    "score": 88,
    "status": "PASSED"
  },
  "next_stage": "6_ECHO"
}
```
