# Technical Implementation Labs

To bridge the gap between theory and execution, the Sovereign Architect Master Class includes these hands-on labs. These labs ensure you can practically implement the 8-stage Sovereign Cycle.

## Lab 1: The Veritas Gate Simulator
**Objective:** Build a simple Python middleware that blocks requests scoring below 85/100.
**Task:**
1. Create a mock `Structure` output JSON.
2. Write a function `veritas_gate(data)` that checks for a `compliance_score` key.
3. If `< 85`, return a simulated `NovaForge` repair request. If `>= 85`, pass to the `Echo` stage.

## Lab 2: Triple-Threat Memory Insertion
**Objective:** Store an execution result into both Episodic and Semantic memory using a local ONNX instance.
**Task:**
1. Spin up a local vector database (e.g., ChromaDB with a lightweight ONNX embedding model).
2. Take a successful task string: *"User requested a python script to parse CSVs. Script was generated successfully."*
3. Save the exact transaction log to the `episodic` collection.
4. Extract the learned skill *"Python CSV Parsing"* and save it to the `semantic` collection for future agents to discover.

## Lab 3: AutonomyAuditor Action Regions
**Objective:** Ensure code can be autonomously repaired by formatting it with LeeWay standard regions.
**Task:**
1. Write a basic 10-line Python calculator script.
2. Wrap the core logic in `# REGION: CORE_LOGIC` and `# ENDREGION: CORE_LOGIC`.
3. Add an intent tag: `# INTENT: Provide basic arithmetic for the Aura UI.`
4. Run the `HeaderInjector.ps1` script to ensure it receives its compliance header and achieves the 85/100 score.

*Completion of these labs is mandatory before final certification by Lee Prime.*
